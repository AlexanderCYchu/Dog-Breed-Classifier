## Project Overview

I build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  
The [dog_app.ipynb](https://github.com/AlexanderCYchu/Dog-Breed-Classifier/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb) is the main analysis.
